Todos - List of things I want to do with my neovim environment
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create plugin for quick notes
    - open floating terminal
    - focus, insert mode
    - jot down a notes
    - send to location
    - create custom commands to send notes to custom pre set locations

2. DocTree (too much for this list)
    - MVP: create easily linkable and configurable text
        + should spend some time researching telescope and treesitter
        to see if

** making a secondary note here to make sure you play around with Telescope a
bit more **

3. Remove Primeagen labels and make your own repo
    - should be legal I think , I'm not selling it or anything

4. Add background image for terminal
    - make this configurable

5. Research configuration best practices (managing environment variables)

6. Make terminal colors/background/opacity more configurable
    - can probably create a script to modify values in the settings.json file
    - probably create themes and switch between those

7. Add errors to lualine
